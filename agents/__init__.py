# __init__.py

# You can leave this empty if you don't need to initialize anything specifically

# Optionally, you can define some package-level variables or functions.
# For example:
__all__ = [
    "agent",
    "trend_analysis_agent",
    "Industry",
    "genai_usecase",
    "resource_reccomendation_agent",
    "collaboration_agent",
    "validation"
]

# This list tells Python what modules to expose if someone imports the package directly.
